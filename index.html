    <p>
      Hello, my name is <strong>Diego Gonzalez</strong> and I am a native
      Austinite, 1st year student at
      <strong> Western Governors University</strong>. 
      I currently am pursuing a degree in Computer Science, seeking to become the best engineer I possibly can become!
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently building my own website by myself with the aid of the
      OdinProject! I intend to learn how to introduce myself to what it is like being a Full Stack developer with
      this curriculum. Stay tuned for more.
    </p>
